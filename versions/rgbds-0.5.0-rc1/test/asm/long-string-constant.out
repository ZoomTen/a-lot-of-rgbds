This paragraph has exactly 257--that's two hundred and
fifty-seven--characters altogether. That's just enough for its last
two characters to be truncated by rgbasm's lexer, since it can't
handle more than 255-character strings. The final two won't print: 
Hello!
Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!Hello!
