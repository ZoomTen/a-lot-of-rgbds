.Dt RGBLINK 1
.Os RGBDS Manual
.Sh NAME
.Nm rgblink
.Nd Game Boy linker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rgblink
.Op Fl dtVw
.Op Fl m Ar mapfile
.Op Fl n Ar symfile
.Op Fl O Ar overlayfile
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl p Ar pad_value
.Op Fl s Ar symbol
.Op Fl l Ar linkerscript
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program links objects created by
.Xr rgbasm 1
into a single Game Boy ROM file.
.Pp
By default, ROM0 sections created by the assembler are placed in the 16KiB
bank 0, and ROMX sections are placed in any bank except bank 0.
If your ROM will only be 32KiB, you can use the
.Fl t
option to override this.
.Pp
Similarly, WRAM0 sections are placed in the first 4KiB of WRAM bank 0 and WRAMX
sections are placed in any bank except bank 0.
If your ROM doesn't use banked WRAM you can use option
.Fl w
option to override this.
.Pp
Also, if your ROM is designed for DMG, you can make sure that you don't use any
prohibited section by using the option
.Fl d ,
which implies
.Fl w
but also prohibits the use of VRAM bank 1.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m Ar mapfile
Write a mapfile to the given filename.
.It Fl n Ar symfile
Write a symbol file to the given filename.
.It Fl O Ar overlayfile
The ROM image to overlay sections over.
When an overlay ROM is provided, all sections must be fixed.
This may be used to patch an existing binray.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Write ROM image to the given filename.
.It Fl p Ar pad_value
When padding an image, pad with this value.
The default is 0x00.
.It Fl s Ar symbol
???
.It Fl w
Expand the WRAM0 section size from 4KiB to the full 8KiB assigned to WRAM and
prohibit the use of WRAMX sections.
.It Fl d
Enable DMG mode.
Prohibit the use of sections that doesn't exist on a DMG, such as WRAMX and VRAM
bank 1.
This option automatically enables
.Fl w .
.It Fl t
Expand the ROM0 section size from 16KiB to the full 32KiB assigned to ROM and
prohibit the use of ROMX sections.
Useful for ROMs that fit in 32 KiB.
.It Fl l Ar linkerscript
Specify a linkerscript file that tells the linker how sections must be placed in
the ROM.
This file has priority over the attributes assigned in the source code, but they
have to be consistent.
See
.Xr rgblink 5
for more information about its format.
.It Fl V
Print the version of the program and exit.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
All you need for a basic ROM is an object file, which can be made into a ROM
image like so:
.Pp
.D1 $ rgblink -o bar.gb foo.o
.Pp
The resulting bar.gb will not have correct checksums
.Pq unless you put them in the assembly source .
You should use
.Xr rgbfix 1
to fix these so that the program will actually run in a Game Boy:
.Pp
.D1 $ rgbfix -v bar.gb

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was originally written by Carsten S\(/orensen as part of the ASMotor package,
and was later packaged in RGBDS by Justin Lloyd. It is now maintained by a
number of contributors at
