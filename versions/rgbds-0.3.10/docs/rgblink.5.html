The linkerscript is an external file that allows the user to specify the order
  of sections without the need for doing so before assembling each object file.
<p class="Pp">The placement of sections specified in the linkerscript is done
    before the sections whose placement is defined in the source code.</p>
<p class="Pp">A linkerscript consists on a series of banks followed by a list of
    sections and, optionally, commands. They can be lowercase or uppercase, it
    is ignored. Any line can contain a comment starting with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">;</code>&#x2019; that ends at the end of the
  line:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
ROMX $F ; This is a comment
  &quot;Functions to read array&quot;
  ALIGN 8
  &quot;Array aligned to 256 bytes&quot;

WRAMX 2
  &quot;Some variables&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Numbers can be in decimal or hexadecimal format (the prefix is
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">$</code>&#x2019;). It is an error if any section
    name or command are found before setting a bank.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files can be included by using the <var class="Ar">INCLUDE</var>
    keyword followed by a string with the path of the file that has to be
    included.</p>
<p class="Pp">The possible bank types are: <b class="Sy">ROM0</b>,
    <b class="Sy">ROMX</b>, <b class="Sy">VRAM</b>, <b class="Sy">WRAM0</b>,
    <b class="Sy">WRAMX</b>, <b class="Sy">OAM</b> and <b class="Sy">HRAM</b>.
    Types <b class="Sy">ROMX</b>, <b class="Sy">VRAM</b>,
    <b class="Sy">WRAMX</b> and <b class="Sy">SRAM</b> are banked, which means
    that it is needed to specify a bank after the type.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a new bank statement is found, sections found after it will
    be placed right from the beginning of that bank. If the linkerscript
    switches to a different bank and then it comes back to the previous one it
    will continue from the last address that was used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only two commands are <var class="Ar">ORG</var> and
    <var class="Ar">ALIGN</var>:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><var class="Ar">ORG</var> sets the address in which new sections will be
      placed. It can not be lower than the current address.</li>
  <li><var class="Ar">ALIGN</var> will increase the address until it is aligned
      to the specified boundary (it tries to set to 0 the number of bits
      specified after the command: <b class="Sy">ALIGN 8</b> will align to
      $100).</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note: The bank, alignment, address and type of sections can be
    specified both in the source code and in the linkerscript. For a section to
    be able to be placed with the linkerscript the bank must be left unassigned
    in the source code or be the same as the one specified in the linkerscript.
    The address and alignment musn't be set.</p>
