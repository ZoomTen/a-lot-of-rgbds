The ASMotor package (xAsm, xLink, RGBFix, examples and documentation) is
freeware and distributed as is. The author retains his copyright and right to
modify the specifications and operation of the software without notice.

In other words this means I encourage you to...

- use it for whatever purpose even professional work without me charging you a
  penny
- copy it to another person (wholly or in part, though I'm sure he'd appreciate
  the whole package) in whatever form you find suitable
- mass-distribute the ASMotor package if it is complete (xAsm, xLink, RGBFix and
  documentation).
- contact me if you have any problems

This also means you can't...

- blame me for loss of profit, data, sleep, food or other nasty things through
  the use or distribution of ASMotor. If you choose to use ASMotor  you do so at
  your own risk.
- expect me to be able to help you should you have a problem related or not to
  ASMotor.
